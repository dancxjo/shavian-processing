This is a little project to help me create a list of "[correct](https://www.shavian.info/spelling/)"
spellings in Shavian. Essentially, the problem is, we can't simply read in the CMU Prouncing Dictionary
because it has merged a lot of vowels that we should distinguish in Shavian; on the other hand, any
RP pronouncing dictionary would not preserve the R coloring of vowels.
